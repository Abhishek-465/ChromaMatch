        <p>1. A 3x3 grid is drawn.</p>
            <p>2. Player 1 uses red, and Player 2 uses green.</p>
            <p>3. Take turns filling an empty cell with your designated color.</p>
            <p>4. Win by having three of your colored cells in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).</p>
            <p>5. If the grid is full and no one has won, it's a draw.</p>
            <p>6. Enjoy the game with colors instead of symbols!</p>
